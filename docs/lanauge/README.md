# Language

Basically, language here means 'languages that humans use'.

In most cases we call it 'natural language', but since there is also 'artificial language', I think the 'natural language' doesn't fit well to the concept I refer.

Instead, I think the 'human language' or the 'social language' would be more prefer.

But anyway, I'll decided to stick to just 'language' for reducing confusions.

To see languages like programming language or markup language, see [Computer Language](../computer_language/README.md) page instead.

This page does not cover that.
